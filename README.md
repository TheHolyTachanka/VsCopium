# Text editor in tauri and vue
This is my first attempt at creating a text editor in Tauri and vue. My expectation is that it will be a simple text editor (not a IDE but there will be stuff like autocompletion, syntax highligthing, etc) So there will be no bloat or settings that no one uses, and there will be no tracking.
