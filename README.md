# Text editor in tauri and vue
This is my first attempt at creating a text editor in Tauri and vue. My expectation is that it will be a simple text editor (not a IDE but there will be stuff like autocompletion, syntax highligthing, etc) So there will be no bloat or settings that no one uses, and there will be no tracking.
Right now it uses the monaco editor(Vscode's editor) as im too lazy to create one right now though i probably will
